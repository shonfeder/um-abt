#+TITLE: Notes

These are rough notes and ideas

* Tasks
** DONE Rework API to use pattern matching on =private= types
** DONE Rework examples to use new API
** TODO Figure out how to expose the type Abt.binding to construction in operators
It would be nice if terms could specify when they took a binding operator.
Maybe with GADTs?
** TODO Use GADTs for a finally tagless style?
