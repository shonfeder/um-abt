# um-abt

An OCaml library implementing abstract binding trees (ABTs) consistent with the
interface defined in Robert Harper's 'Practical Foundations for Programming
Languages', using immutable pointers for variable binding.

The approach taken here has also been informed by Neel Krishnaswami's [post on
ABTs](https://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2015/03/abstract-binding-trees.html)
and Callan McGill's post, ["Locally
Nameless"](https://boarders.github.io/posts/locally-nameless.html).
