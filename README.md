# um-abt

An OCaml library implementing abstract binding trees (ABTs) consistent with the
interface defined in [Robert Harper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/)'s
[Practical Foundations for Programming](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/),
using immutable pointers for variable binding.

The approach taken here has also been informed by [Neel
Krishnaswami](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/)'s [post on
ABTs](https://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2015/03/abstract-binding-trees.html)
and Callan McGill's post, ["Locally
Nameless"](https://boarders.github.io/posts/locally-nameless.html).
